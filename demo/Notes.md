Goal: 
Build a neural network model that trains other neural network models to learn input data from different sources.

We define the hierarchy of the model as comprising of neolets and neopro. The relationship is such that neolets are children of neopro. At this stage, a neopro can have one or more neolets. Neopro learns the behavior of neolets using the characteristics of a neolet as input and the error function as the output.
Neolets are trained to learn data such as financial data that can be used for forecasting. The configuration of neolets varies, which could be in form of the number of input layer, the type training function, and any processing mechanism used to transform the data to fit into a dimension fit for learning.
